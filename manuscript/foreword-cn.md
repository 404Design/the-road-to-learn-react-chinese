# 前言

> The Road to learn React teaches you the fundamentals of React. You will build a real world application along the way in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by me, Robin Wieruch, and the community.

《》会教您一些React的基础知识。通过这套教程，您可以用纯React构建一个真正可用的应用程序，而不需要去理会其他复杂的工具。从开发环境的准备到部署上线的所有过程都会被一一介绍。本书每一章都包含一些额外的索引资料以及课后练习。在读完本书之后，您会有能力依靠自己构建一个React应用。这些资料会被我，Robin Wieruch，以及整个社区维护和更新。

> In the Road to learn React, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information around React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world React application.

通过《》，我想在您陷入到庞大的React生态圈之前，奠定一个良好的基础。她会通过一个真实可用的React应用来解释基本概念，设计模式以及一些最佳实践。

> You will learn to build your own React application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript and helps you to get started.

您会学着构建您自己的React应用。她会涵盖一些真正可用的功能，比如分页，客户端缓存，以及像搜索和排序这样的交互功能。另外在这个过程中，您会慢慢从JavaScript ES5过渡到JavaScript ES6.我希望这本书能点燃你对React和JavaScript的热情，并让你能够开始使用他们。

> **A Rookie Developer:** "I just finished the book as a rookie developer, thanks for working on this. It was easy to follow and I feel confident in starting a new app from scratch in the coming days. The book was much better than official React.js tutorial that I tried earlier (and couldn't complete due to lack of detail). The exercises at the end of each section were very rewarding."

**一个新手开发:** “作为一个新手开发，我刚刚完成了这本书的学习，非常感谢写了这本书。她非常容易上手，我相信自己在接下来的几天可以开始从头开发一个新应用。这本书比官方的React入门文档好很多，我之前有试过（但是我完全无法继续下去，因为缺乏一些细节的知识点）。每个章节后面的练习题对我有很好的激励效果。”

> **Student:** "The best book to start learning ReactJS. The project moves along with the concepts being learnt which helps to grasp the subject. I have found 'Code and learn' as best way to master programming and this book exactly does that."

**一个学生:** “这是最好的学习React的一本书。我们可以一边做练习项目，一边学习知识点，然后还能紧扣我们的学习主题。我发现‘边码边学’是最好的掌握编程的方法，而这本书完完全全是这样教我的。”

> **[Thomas Lockney](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1880673388):** "Pretty solid introduction to React that doesn't try to be comprehensive. I just wanted a taste to understand what it was about and this book gave me exactly that. I didn't follow all the little footnotes to learn about the new ES6 features I've missed ("I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob."). But I'm sure for those of you who have fallen behind and are diligent about following those, you can probably learn a lot more than just what the book teaches."

**[Thomas Lockney](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1880673388):** “这是一本非常扎实的介绍React的书，完全不需要其他综合性的内容。我本来只想尝试看看这本书到底怎么样，然后我得出了上面的结论。我并没有跟着所有的脚注来学习我还没有注意到的新的ES6语法（我当然不会说我一直没有注意到，Bob）（译者注，这个是在博客中与另外一个朋友互动的话）。但是我想很肯定的对那些没有及时了解到这些新功能并且很勤奋的跟着练习的朋友们说，你们可以额外学到很多书中没有的知识。”

# Education for Children

The book should enable everyone to learn React. However, not everyone is privileged to use those resources, because not everyone is educated in the English language in the first place. Thus I want to use the project to support projects that teach children English in the developing world.

# FAQ

**How do I get updates?** You can [subscribe](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) to the Newsletter or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) for updates. Once you have a copy of the book, it will stay updated when a new edition gets released. But you have to grab the copy again when an update is announced.

**Does it use the recent React version?** The book always receives an update when the React version got updated. Usually books are outdated pretty soon after their release. Since this book is self-published, I can update it whenever I want.

**Does it cover Redux?** It doesn't. Therefore I have written a second book. The Road to learn React should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics. The implementation of the sample application in the book will show that you don't need Redux to build an application in React. After you have read the book, you should be able to implement a solid application without Redux. Then you can read my second book to learn [Redux](https://roadtoreact.com/course-details?courseId=TAMING_THE_STATE).

**Does it use JavaScript ES6?** Yes. But don't worry. You will be fine if you are familiar with JavaScript ES5. All JavaScript ES6 features, that I describe on the journey to learn React, will transition from ES5 to ES6 in the book. Every feature along the way will be explained. The book does not only teach React, but also all useful JavaScript ES6 features for React.

**Will you add more chapters in the future?** You can have a look at the Change Log chapter for major updates that already happened. There will be unannounced improvements in between too. In general, it depends on the community whether I continue to work on the book. If there is an acceptance for the book, I will deliver more chapters and improve the old material. I will keep the content up to date with recent best practices, concepts and patterns.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading the book. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can improve your learnings too.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?** If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. In addition, you could have a look into the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react/issues) for the book. Perhaps your problem was already mentioned and you can find the solution for it. If your problem wasn't mentioned, don't hesitate to open a new issue where you can explain your problem, maybe provide a screenshot, and some more details (e.g. book page, node version). After all, I try to ship all fixes in next editions of the book.

**Can I help to improve it?** Yes. You can have a direct impact with your thoughts and [contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). I don't claim to be an expert nor to write in native English. I would appreciate your help very much.

**Can I support the project?** Yes. Feel free to reach out. I invest a lot of my time into open source tutorials and learning resources. You can have a look at my [about me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) page. I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning React or might not yet be aware about wanting to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.

# How to read it?

The book is my attempt to teach React while you will write an application. It is a practical guide to learn React and not a reference work about React. You will write a Hacker News application that interacts with a real world API. Among several interesting topics, it covers state management in React, caching and interactions (sorting and searching). On the way you will learn best practices and patterns in React.

In addition, the book gives you a transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. React embraces a lot of JavaScript ES6 features and I want to show you how you can use them.

In general each chapter of the book will build up on the previous chapter. Each chapter will teach you something new. Don't rush through the book. You should internalize each step. You could apply your own implementations and read more about the topic. After each chapter I give you some reading material and exercises. If you really want to learn React, I highly recommend to read the extra material and do some hands on exercises. After you have read a chapter, make yourself comfortable with the learnings before you continue.

In the end you will have a complete React application in production. I am very keen to see your results, so please text me when you have finished the book. The final chapter of the book will give you a handful of options to continue your React journey. In general you will find a lot of React related topics on [my personal website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/).

Since you are reading the book, I guess you are new to React. That's perfect. In the end I hope to get your feedback to improve the material to enable everyone to learn React. You can have a direct impact on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react) or text me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch).
