# Outline | 大纲/概述

That was the last chapter of the book. I hope you enjoyed reading it and that it helped you to get traction in React. If you liked the book, share it as a way to learn React with your friends. It should be used as giveaway. In addition, you could take 5 minutes to write a quick review about it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B077HJFCQX).

这是本书的最后一章。我希望你阅读愉快，并能从中学习如何掌握 React。如果你喜欢这本书，请将其作为学习 React 的一种方法推荐给你的朋友们。授人玫瑰，手有余香。此外，若不介意的话请花上五分钟在[亚马逊](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B077HJFCQX)上写个短评。

**But where can you go from here after reading this book?** You can either extend the application on your own or give your own React project a shot. Before you dive into another book, course or tutorial, you should create your own hands-on React project. Do it for one week, take it to production by deploying it somewhere, and reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) to showcase it. I am curious what you will build after you have read the book and I will gladly share it with my followers. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch) to share your repository.

**但是阅读本书之后，你又将从何开始/去向何处呢？**你可以自行扩展这个应用，也可以尝试构建自己的 React 项目。在你深入另一本书、课程或教程之前，你应该动手创建属于自己的 React 项目。持续做上一周，把它上线部署到某个地方，通过 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) 联系我把它展示出来。我很好奇你在看到本书之后会创造出点什么，我也很乐于跟我的粉丝们一起分享你的作品。你也可以在 [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch) 找到我并分享你的代码版本库。

If you are looking for further extensions for your application, I can recommend several learning paths after you have used only plain React in this book:

如果你需要进一步扩展你的应用程序，那么在本书中只是单纯操练 React 过后，我会再推荐几个学习路径：

* **State Management:** You have used React `this.setState()` and `this.state` to manage and access local component state. That's a perfect start. However, in a larger application you will experience the [limits of React's local component state](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-before-using-redux/). Therefore you can use a third-party state management library such as [Redux or MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/). On the course platform [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com/), you will find the course "Taming the State in React" that teaches advanced local state in React, Redux and MobX. The course comes with an ebook as well, but I recommend everyone to dive into the source code and screencasts too. If you liked this book, you should definitely checkout Taming the State in React.
* **状态管理：**相信你已经使用过 React 中的 `this.setState()` 和 `this.state` ，用于管理和存取组件内部 state。千里之行，始于足下。（/好的开端是成功的一半。）然而在更大型的项目中，你就会切身体会到 [React 组件内部 state 的局限性](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-before-using-redux/)。因此你可以使用任一第三方的状态管理库，比如说 [Redux 或 MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/)。你会发现在 [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com/) 授课平台上，"Taming the State in React" 这门课程将会传授 Redux、MobX 与 React 本地 state 的进阶内容。这门课程也会包含一本电子书，但我鼓励大家可以深入到源代码和相应的截屏当中去。如果你喜欢这本书，那么毫无疑问你也应该看一看 Taming the State in React（驯化 React 中的状态/state）。
* **Sample Projects:** After learning plain React, it is always good to apply the learnings first in your own projects before learning something new. You could write your own tic-tac-toe game or a simple calculator in React. There are plenty of tutorials out there that use only React to build something exciting. Check out mine about building [a paginated and infinite scrolling list](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-paginated-list/), [showcasing tweets on a Twitter wall](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-svg-patterns/) or [connecting your React application to Stripe for charging money](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-express-stripe-payment/). Experiment with these mini applications to get comfortable in React.
* **Code Organization:** On your way reading the book you came across one chapter about code organization. You could apply these changes now, if you haven't done it yet. It will organize your components in structured files and folders (modules). In addition, it helps to understand and learn the principles of code splitting, reusability, maintainability and module API design.
* **Testing:** The book only scratched the surface of testing. If you are not familiar with the general topic, you could dive deeper into the concepts of unit testing and integration testing, especially in context of React applications. On an implementation level, I would recommend to stick to Enzyme and Jest in order to refine your approach of testing with unit tests and snapshot tests in React.
* **Asynchronous Requests:** You can substitute the native fetch API with third-party alternatives to perform asynchronous requests: [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) or [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios). There is no perfect solution to make asynchronous requests. But by exchanging the buildings blocks around React, you make the experience [how powerful it can be to have this flexibility](https://www.robinwieruch.de/reasons-why-i-moved-from-angular-to-react/). In frameworks you usually stick to one solution. In a [flexible ecosystem like React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/essential-react-libraries-framework/) you can exchange the solutions.
* **Routing:** You can implement routing for your application with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). So far, you only have one page in your application. React Router helps you to have multiple pages across multiple URLs. When you introduce routing to your application, you don't make any requests to your web server to fetch the next page. The router will do everything for you on the client-side.
* **Type Checking:** In one chapter, you have used React PropTypes to define component interfaces. It is a good practice to prevent bugs. But the PropTypes are only checked on runtime. You can go one step further to introduce static type checking on compile time. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is one popular approach. But in the React ecosystem, people often use [Flow](https://flowtype.org/). I can recommend to give Flow a shot if you are interested to make your application more robust.
* **Tooling with Webpack and Babel:** In the book you have used *create-react-app* to set up your application. At some point, when you have learned React, you might want to learn the tooling around it. It enables you to setup your own project without *create-react-app*. I can recommend to follow a minimal setup with [Webpack and Babel](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/). Afterward you can apply more tooling on your own. For instance, you could [use ESLint](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/) to follow a unified code style in your application.
* **React Native:** [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) brings your application on mobile devices. You can apply your learnings from React to ship iOS and Android applications. The learning curve, once you have learned React, shouldn't be steep in React Native. Both share the same principles. You will only encounter different layout components on mobile than you are used to in web applications.

Once again, if you liked the book, I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others. It will improve over time when more people read it and share their feedback with me.

允许我再啰嗦一次，如果你喜欢这本书，我希望你能花点时间想一想谁比较适合学习 React。联系他们然后把这本书分享给他。这对我真的很重要，这本书就旨在与他人分享。随着时间的推移，越来越多的人会阅读并与我分享他们的反馈意见。

Thank you a lot for reading the Road to learn React.

由衷地感谢你阅读本书，《React 斩荆之路》。
